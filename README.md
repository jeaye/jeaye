## Hi folks

I primarily work on [jank](https://jank-lang.org), the native Clojure dialect on LLVM.

Most of my projects are related to Clojure, C++, or Rust, and I'm trying to find the sweet spot between the three of them. That's where jank comes in.

I also run the [Compiler Spotlight](https://compilerspotlight.substack.com/) newsletter, which showcases programming languages and compilers.
